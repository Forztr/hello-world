# hello-world
My first GitHub repository.

Old timer finally who's finally decided to update his 1980's coding skills into the 21st century. This may take me some time, apparently spaghetti code is no longer cool and an Atari 800xl just doesn't have the grunt for what I want to do. See now I said that I want to dig out the dang machine and see if it still works. I hope procastination is still a thing I'd hate to think all my old skills are redundant.
